          The rt-labs CANopen stack c-open is used for both master and
          slaves. The stack implements most of CiA 301 and 305
          (LSS). The stack is written to an OS abstraction layer and
          can also be used in a bare metal application. Using the
          abstraction layer, the stack can run on Linux, Windows or on
          an RTOS.

          A simple slave is included to serve as an example of how to
          use the stack. The slave can also be used to run the CiA
          Conformance Test Tool.

          Also included is a simple master example that lists all
          slaves on the bus and a comprehensive set of unit-tests.
