          The rt-labs PROFINET stack p-net is used for PROFINET device
          implementations. It is easy to use and provides a small
          footprint. It is especially well suited for embedded systems
          where resources are limited and efficiency is crucial.

          It is written in C and can be run on bare-metal hardware, an
          RTOS such as rt-kernel, or on Linux or Windows. The main
          requirement is that the platform can send and receive RAW
          Ethernet Layer 2 frames. The p-net stack is supplied with
          full sources including a porting layer.
